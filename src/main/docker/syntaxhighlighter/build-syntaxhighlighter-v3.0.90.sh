# In order to build "SyntaxHighlighter v3.0.90" [1], you might want to read the
# bit more verbose guide by Blaise Liu [2]. Beside, you need an old "Node.js".
# Otherwise, when running "grunt" an error is thrown:
#     Error: Module did not self-register
#
# Instead of fixing this situation by installing the old "Node.js" [3], I prefer
# the containered way [4]:
#     docker run -it --rm --name node-build-env -v "$PWD":/home/bob/workspace \
#            node:0.10.32 \
#            /bin/bash
